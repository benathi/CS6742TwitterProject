__________________________________________________
This repository is the code base for code-switching NLP project. 
The goal is to identify significant n-grams (Thai) that contribute 
to the occurrence of code-switching. The ML algorithm used is lasso 
regression. This also gives a predictor of whether there will be a 
code-switching instance given the features(n-grams). 

Future work: refine the determination of code-switching with translation API. 
This will generalize the work to more general base language. 


Author's note: The code could be cleaner but I figured I should make
the code public in case it might help others. I plan to clean this up soon.
